    "# Probabilistic Robotics for State Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic robotics is a framework that deals with uncertainty in robot perception and action by using probability theory. It's especially valuable for state estimation - determining where a robot is and what's around it in uncertain environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea is that a robot's belief about its state (position, orientation, etc.) and the environment is represented as a probability distribution rather than as single, deterministic values. This approach acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensor measurements** (noise, limited range, occlusions)\n",
    "2. **Motion actions** (wheel slippage, uneven terrain)\n",
    "3. **Environment dynamics** (moving objects, changing conditions)\n",

    "- $p(z|x)$ is the likelihood of getting measurement $z$ given state $x$\n",
    "- $p(x|z)$ is the posterior belief after incorporating measurement $z$\n",

    "### State Estimation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "State estimation typically follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction Step (Motion Model)**: When a robot moves, uncertainty increases.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$p(x_t|u_t,x_{t-1}) $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This transition model describes how state $x$ changes when control $u$ is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update Step (Measurement Model)**: When sensors provide data, uncertainty decreases.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$p(z_t|x_t)$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This sensor model describes the probability of getting measurement $z$ in state $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Belief Update**: Combining the above using Bayes' rule.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$bel(x_t) = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t|x_t) \\int p(x_t|u_t,x_{t-1}) \\cdot bel(x_{t-1}) \\, dx_{t-1}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where $\\eta$ is a normalizing constant and $bel(x_t)$ is the belief at time $t$.\n",

    "## Simple Example: Robot Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple 1D robot moving along a line, with:\n",
    "- A motion model that attempts to move forward 1 unit each step but has noise\n",
    "- A sensor that can detect a pole in the tunnel with some uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Belief\n",
    "The robot starts with a uniform belief about its position - it could be anywhere with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Step\n",
    "The robot attempts to move forward 1 unit by applying motor controls. Due to uncertainty in motion:\n",
    "- If it's at position $x$ now, it might end up at $x+0.8$, $x+1.0$, or $x+1.2$ with different probabilities\n",
    "- This \"smears\" the belief forward and increases uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "$$bel^-(x_t) = \\int p(x_t|u_t,x_{t-1}) \\cdot bel(x_{t-1}) \\, dx_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Step\n",
    "The robot takes a sensor measurement and detects a pole 2 metres away, but with some uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sensor is perfect, positions exactly 2 units from the pole would have probability 1.0, and all others 0.0. But with noise:\n",
    "- Positions 1.8-2.2 units from the pole might have high probability\n",
    "- Positions further away have lower probability\n",

    "$$bel(x_t) = \\eta \\cdot p(z_t|x_t) \\cdot bel^-(x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "After combining the prediction and update, the robot has a revised belief about its position - typically a sharper, more certain distribution than before.\n",

    "1. Start with high uncertainty\n",

    "3. Take measurements to reduce uncertainty\n",
